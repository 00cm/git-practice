# Just Practicing

I recently completed a homework assignment that left me **very** confused about how to use git effectively. I decided I needed to practice. 


This particular repository will contain activities from The Odin Project, as well as from my own urges. You are welcome to join me, or make comments and/or suggestions if the mood strikes. 

## Particularly Useful Commands

`git remote -v` shows me which URL a repo has come from, and which URL my changes will push to. I could have definitely used this command in my homework assingment.
